# MYABY Project

This project was a collaboration in the software side to build a device which is able to show different didactics for children about basic knowledge about English and Spanish language using videos, images and text.

The device is a Bear made of wood, it has a self-made keyboard, a card reader(MFRC522), a screen monitor, and a Raspberry Pi as a platform where all the software is executed.

    <tr>
        <td><img src="resources/img/project/img2.jpg" atl="Dispositivo Base" width="300" height="300"></td>
        <td><img src="resources/img/project/img1.jpg" atl="Dispositivo Base" width="300" height="300"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

In the program, there are 3 main didactics-features:

- **Observe:** Show a random video about tales.
- **Learn:** Show musical videos about basic concept of the language.
- **Interact:** Allow to read a card which is linked with a word, then the child can press the keys and introduce the letters corresponding to complete the word selected.
